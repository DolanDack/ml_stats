## The Fallacy of P-values

I have been working for at least 10 years as a statistical modeller (as of 2021), mainly in the financial industry, and a common parameter on every project that I had was to accept or reject a model (and the findings) based  on the p-values. 

In his article, Krantz (1999), talked about the p-values,  what do they really mean and what's their significance in research. There are some major concerns about p-values as a model decision approach:
1. p-values are dichotomous, so just  for 0.05 criterion  to take decisions.
2. low p-value does not prove that H_{0}, the null hypothesis,  is false.
3. there is a general confusion of what a p-value is, pr(D|H) or the pr(H|D)?
4. we cannot reject the null based on the p-values, as the p-value is a conditional probability that already considers the null as true. 

Krantz (1999), actually provides  a very good introduction to the p-value debate  and a non-mathematical explanation of what and whatnot the p-values are.
