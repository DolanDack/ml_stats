# ml_stats
This repository is my attempt to contribute to the machine learning/computational statistics community. I aim to update its content as often as possible, which it will include machine learning algorithms, their statistical background, practical problems with their code in R and python.

Right now, I do not have a solid idea of what the contents are going to be or how often I will update the topics (I said as often as possible but that is rather vague). I guess, it will be a "trial-and-error" period until I reach something solid. Ultimately, I would very much like to give an interactive essence to this repository, with people contributing ideas/codes/and topics.

A rough outline of the content I *aim* to cover is:
- Statistical Data Analysis
* It will include subsections like, data preprocessing, Bayesian Statistical Analysis and GLM's and Timeseries analysis
- Unsupervised ML
- Supervised ML
- Neural Networks
